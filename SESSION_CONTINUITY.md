# Session Continuity Guide

## How to Resume Development

### 1. Check Current Status
```bash
# Read the current project status
cat PROJECT_STATUS.md

# Check development checklist
cat DEVELOPMENT_CHECKLIST.md

# Review any pending todos
# (This will be shown automatically when session resumes)
```

### 2. Identify Last Completed Phase
- Look for ✅ COMPLETED markers in PROJECT_STATUS.md
- Check the "IN PROGRESS" section for current work
- Review DEVELOPMENT_CHECKLIST.md for specific tasks

### 3. Resume Development
- Start from the next pending task in the checklist
- Follow the zero-error development principles
- Update status files as work progresses

## Zero-Error Development Reminders

### Always Remember:
1. **TypeScript Strict Mode**: No `any` types allowed
2. **Test Coverage**: 95%+ for all new code
3. **Code Review**: All code must be reviewed
4. **Documentation**: Update docs with every change
5. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling required
6. **Validation**: Input validation at all boundaries
7. **Security**: Security-first approach
8. **Performance**: Monitor and optimize continuously

### Before Starting Any Task:
- [ ] Read the task requirements carefully
- [ ] Check existing code for patterns
- [ ] Write tests first (TDD approach)
- [ ] Plan the implementation
- [ ] Consider error scenarios
- [ ] Think about edge cases

### After Completing Any Task:
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Code reviewed
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Status files updated
- [ ] No linting errors
- [ ] Performance acceptable
- [ ] Security scan clean

## File Structure for Continuity
```
/workspace/
├── PROJECT_STATUS.md          # Overall project status
├── DEVELOPMENT_CHECKLIST.md   # Detailed task checklist
├── SESSION_CONTINUITY.md     # This file
├── ZERO_ERROR_PRINCIPLES.md  # Development standards
├── ARCHITECTURE.md           # System architecture
├── API_DOCUMENTATION.md      # API specifications
├── TESTING_STRATEGY.md       # Testing approach
└── DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md       # Deployment procedures
```

## Quick Commands for Status Check
```bash
# Check current todos
# (This will be shown automatically)

# Check project status
cat PROJECT_STATUS.md | grep -A 5 "IN PROGRESS"

# Check next pending tasks
cat DEVELOPMENT_CHECKLIST.md | grep -A 10 "Phase [0-9]"

# Check quality metrics
cat PROJECT_STATUS.md | grep -A 10 "Quality Metrics"
```

## Emergency Recovery
If something goes wrong:
1. Check the last successful commit
2. Review error logs
3. Rollback to last known good state
4. Fix the issue
5. Re-run all tests
6. Update documentation

## Communication Protocol
- Update PROJECT_STATUS.md after each major milestone
- Mark completed tasks with ✅
- Update timestamps and dates
- Add notes about any issues or decisions
- Keep DEVELOPMENT_CHECKLIST.md current
