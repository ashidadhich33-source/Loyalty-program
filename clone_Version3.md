# Example: Bulk Import/Export Flow

- **Importing Products**
  - User downloads sample Excel/CSV (with columns: Name, SKU, Size, Age, Color, Brand, Price, etc.)
  - User fills data, uploads file.
  - System previews data, validates, shows errors if any.
  - User confirms import.

- **Exporting Products**
  - User exports products based on filters (e.g., only "babywear").
  - Receives Excel/CSV with all product fields.

- **Same flow for Purchase Orders and Purchase Returns.**

---

# Example: Custom Report Use Cases

- **"Bulk Imported Items with Errors"**: Reports from product.bulk_import, purchase.bulk_import, etc.
- **"Purchase Returns by Reason/Month"**: Reports from purchase_return.bulk_import.

---

# Extending & Cloning Principles

- **Modular**: Each business area is a separate module, install/uninstall as needed.
- **Customizable**: End users can tailor forms, lists, and reports without coding.
- **API-first**: All data/models exposed via REST/GraphQL for integrations.
- **Localization-ready**: Indian compliance out-of-the-box, other regions possible.
- **Retail-specific Enhancements**: Child-centric attributes, loyalty, quick checkout, inventory turnover, size/age/season-aware logic, advanced POS with exchange, return, multi-payment, discount logic, bulk import/export, and deep reporting.
